I started my comp sci education in my senior year of high school taking a programming class learning the basics of Java. Unfortunately, I dropped that class half way through the year. I was more than capable of doing it; however, I was lazy and fell far behind and I needed passing grades to play sports. After high school I joined the miliary as an Information Technology Specialist. Doing this I learned the bare bones of networking including IP addressing, security protocols, CCNA, and making CAT 5 cables. Learned to build a LAN in a small team. I don’t particularly like this side of computers and I found programing and development to be more interesting. So, I got my two-year degree at OCCC. I started as a comp sci major then switched to a Liberal Arts in math and science to transfer to New Paltz faster and continue my comp sci degree here. I have taken scripting classes learning python however, I can’t say I remember much of that. It was around 4 years ago that I took it. Comp sci 1 at OCCC was in C++ so I have a pretty good grasp of C and C++ after assembly, HTML and CSS due to taking the web design class here, and Java.

After the first day and listening to you explain how applicable this course will be in our careers, I hope to use the knowledge I learn in this class throughout my career. I think one of the biggest things to learn may be to just figure it out. After all work will not be like school, we will be working 8+ hours a day on one thing. As explained, in this course we get an outline, and we fill in the gaps on our own, and then apply it. Thinking of it like that, I hope it will be the closest thing we get to working in the real world of development. Being versatile and able to adjust, figure things out on the go I would think is more valuable than most education a person might already have.
